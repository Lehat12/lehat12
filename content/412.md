The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
412 Precondition Failed client error response code
indicates that access to the target resource has been denied. This happens with
conditional requests on methods other than GET or
HEAD when the condition defined by the
If-Unmodified-Since or If-None-Match headers is not
fulfilled. In that case, the request, usually an upload or a modification of a resource,
cannot be made and this error response is sent back.
