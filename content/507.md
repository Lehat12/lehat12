The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 507 Insufficient Storage response status code may be given in the context of the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol (see RFC 4918).

It indicates that a method could not be performed because the server cannot store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.
