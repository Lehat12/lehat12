The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 301 Moved Permanently redirect status response code indicates that the requested resource has been definitively moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to the new URL and search engines update their links to the resource.

  Note: Although the specification requires the method and the body to remain unchanged when the redirection is performed, not all user-agents meet this requirement. Use the 301 code only as a response for GET or HEAD methods and use the 308 Permanent Redirect for POST methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with this status.
