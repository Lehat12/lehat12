The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
411 Length Required client error response code indicates
that the server refuses to accept the request without a defined
Content-Length header.



  Note: by specification, when sending data in a series of chunks, the
  Content-Length header is omitted and at the beginning of each chunk you
  need to add the length of the current chunk in hexadecimal format. See
  Transfer-Encoding for more details.
