The HTTP 207 Multi-Status response code indicates that there might be a mixture of responses.

The response body is a text/xml or application/xml HTTP entity with a multistatus root element. The XML body will list all individual response codes.


  Note: The ability to return a collection of resources is part of the WebDAV protocol (it may be received by web applications accessing a WebDAV server).
  Browsers accessing web pages will never encounter this status code.
