The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
308 Permanent Redirect redirect status response code
indicates that the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by
the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page and search
engines update their links to the resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that the
'link-juice' is sent to the new URL).

The request method and the body will not be altered, whereas 301 may
incorrectly sometimes be changed to a GET method.



  Note: Some Web applications may use the
  308 Permanent Redirect in a non-standard way and for other purposes. For
  example, Google Drive uses a 308 Resume Incomplete response to indicate
  to the client when an incomplete upload stalled. (See Perform a resumable download on Google Drive documentation.)
